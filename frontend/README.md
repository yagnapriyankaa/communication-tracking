# Email Tracking Service - Frontend

The frontend interface for the **Email Tracking Service** was developed as part of an internship project. Built with **Angular** and **Angular Material**, it simulates email tracking UI functionality using mock data for testing and demonstration.

## Features

- **Submission Form**: Form-based UI to submit mock email tracking requests with fields for `Batch ID` and `Account ID`.
- **Request Table**: Displays mock email request statuses with columns such as Batch ID, Scheduled Date, Email Status, and SFMC Status.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Allows filtering by Account ID and date for quick access to specific mock data.
